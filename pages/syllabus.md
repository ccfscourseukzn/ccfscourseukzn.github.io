#### Course Description 
This course will introduce trainees to concepts of climate change, nutrition, diet, food systems, remote sensing and planetary health and the descriptive application of these concepts. Part two of the course will look at linking these concepts and analysis of data.
The Remote Sensing and spatial analysis section seeks to provide theoretical concepts underpinning Remote Sensing applications related to Food Systems, Climate Change and Planetary Health. This include image pre-processing using open source software and basic spatial analysis using optical and thermal remotely sensed data. The section provides a basis for the advanced phase of the course on Food Systems, Climate Change and Planetary Health spatial analysis to be offered towards the end of 2023. 

In **week 1**, participants will be introduced to several deep learning methods and techniques in a sequence of lectures and practical exercises involving computer applications using relevant real data sets in the health domain.

In **week 2**, participants will be engage in advanced deep learning techniques with real-life applications in public health.

#### Learning Objectives
At the end of the two weeks, participants would be able to apply the following deep learning methods and techniques to their health datasets or health domain of their interest: 

1.	Understand deep learning notations, terminologies, and performance metrics.
2.	Use neural network architecture, mluti-layer perceptrons, backpropagation, and regularization techniques.
3.	Understanding the CNNs models and their applications to public health domain.
4.	Use RNNs and their application to climate and time series health data.
5.  Understanding the transformers and transfer learning and model building in health data.
6.	Properly compare models using appropriate statistical approaches for fair model comparison.
7.	Interpret deep learning results and write reports on them.
