His research includes the epidemiology of adverse pregnancy outcomes, childhood infections, and HIV, TB and malaria. He established the Nutrition and Global Health Program at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, that addresses and documents existing gaps; advances the research agenda; and convenes multi-disciplinary partners. He also developed two implementation science initiatives to advance adolescent health in Africa and Asia, and the intersectoral integration of agriculture, nutrition and health in Ethiopia and Tanzania. He established the Africa Research, Implementation Science, and Education (ARISE) Network, a partnership of leading academic institutions in Africa, and the China Harvard Africa Network (CHAN) to advance cutting-edge training of public health leaders through South-South-North institutional partnerships.

Dr. Madzorera is a nutrition epidemiologist with interests in the intersection of food systems, nutrition and sustainable diets in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The goals of her research program are to utilize advanced nutrition epidemiologic methods to assess diet quality as a key modifiable risk factor for poor maternal and child health outcomes in LMICs, and to identify the role of food systems and other contributing factors to the triple burden of malnutrition in these contexts. Dr. Madzorera has led global health research focusing on the evaluation of food systems and diet quality, and their influence on maternal and child health.  Her previous research has included evaluating the role of maternal diet quality during pregnancy and its impacts on the risk of low birth weight, small for gestational age and preterm births, and also assessing the effect of COVID-19 on food prices and diets. Dr. Madzorera has extensive field-based experience including leading maternal and child nutrition interventions in sub-Saharan Africa. She has spent considerable time working in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique and conducted research in Tanzania and Ethiopia. Dr. Madzorera has an ScD in Nutritional Epidemiology from the Harvard School of Public Health.
