    <td class="tg-0lax"> Wafaie Fawziâ€™s research has generated significant new knowledge on the discovery and translation of interventions to enhance maternal and child health and human development, with emphasis on nutritional factors. His research includes the epidemiology of adverse pregnancy outcomes, childhood infections, and HIV, TB and malaria. He established the Nutrition and Global Health Program at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, that addresses and documents existing gaps; advances the research agenda; and convenes multi-disciplinary partners. He also developed two implementation science initiatives to advance adolescent health in Africa and Asia, and the intersectoral integration of agriculture, nutrition and health in Ethiopia and Tanzania. He established the Africa Research, Implementation Science, and Education (ARISE) Network, a partnership of leading academic institutions in Africa, and the China Harvard Africa Network (CHAN) to advance cutting-edge training of public health leaders through South-South-North institutional partnerships.

Currently, amongst many other projects, I am leading a project that implements novel measurements of wearables in vulnerable populations in Kenya and Burkina Faso to conduct cutting-edge climate change and health research, which helpd us gain new insights into the disease burden in poor populations facing exposure to climate change, such as heat or droughts. Furthermore, I lead the Blended Learning in Zambia (BLiZ) project that implements blended learning to strengthen medical education at the largest medical University in Zambia. In my research, I apply a variety of analytics models and cross-cutting analytics modeling concepts and cases.</td>
